    <!-- How We Work Section -->
    <section class="explanation">
      <h2>How Is This Possible?</h2>
      <p>
        When you buy a Roblox catalog item through a game, Roblox gives us a small
        <strong>affiliate commission</strong>. We pass most of it back to you as cashback
        and keep a small portion to keep the service running.
      </p>

    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <section class="faq">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this safe?</h3>
        <p>Yes! We use Roblox's official affiliate commission system. You're buying items the normal way - just through our game instead of the catalog directly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why is there a 7-day wait?</h3>
        <p>Roblox holds affiliate commissions for 7 days before releasing them. We pass this same waiting period to you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I withdraw?</h3>
        <p>Once your balance reaches 100 Robux and the 7-day pending period is over, you can request a withdrawal. We'll send Robux directly to your account via group payout or by purchasing your gamepass.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does this work for all items?</h3>
        <p>Most catalog items work, including accessories, clothing, and game passes. However, bundles (like Headless Horseman) typically don't work with the affiliate system.</p>

    <!-- Payout Info -->
    <section class="payout-info">
      <h2>Payout Timeline</h2>
      <p>Roblox holds affiliate commissions for <strong>7 days</strong> before releasing them, so your cashback will be pending during that time.</p>
      <p>To receive payouts, you'll need to join our Roblox group (there's a 14-day membership requirement before your first payout).</p>
